Here in this directory they have general project wide gradle files called
coverage.gradle and libraries.gradle for test coverage including
reports and specifications, and libraries respectively.


They also have other folders in app/src for base url and flavor settings. Some have raw folder
(in a res folder) full of .pem files for public key and other key stuff.
